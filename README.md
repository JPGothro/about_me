Stuff about me
- Getting ready to commit the initial code.
- Tom is the driver extrodinaire, and John is the Not Netscape Navigator!
- We worked on the code like a couple of bosses...

- Reworking this, moving games to a separate page.
- I just realized I should have created a new branch for all these changes. If for no other reason than the practice!
