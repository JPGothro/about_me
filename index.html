  <h1>You know it's all about John</h1>
  <p>As you should have realized, <strong>John</strong> is the center of the universe. Or as he calls it, the <i>John-verse</i>. Since you are in his orbit, it would make sense to know something about him. Darkness and cruelty await those who don't.</p>
  <h2>In case you think you know...</h2>
  <p>Here are some questions to test your actual knowledge of all things John:</p>
  <ol id="questions">
    <li id="answer1">Was John born in the Pacific Northwest?</li>
    <li id="answer2">Does John have a valid passport?</li>
    <li id="answer3">Has John ever had a broken bone?</li>
    <li id="answer4">Has he had any viable off-spring?</li>
    <li id="answer5">Is John a friend-of-dogs?</li>
  </ol>
