      <h1>You know it's all about John</h1>
      <p>As you should have realized, <strong>John</strong> is the center of the universe. Or as he calls it, the <i>John-verse</i>. Since you are in his orbit, it would make sense to know something about him. Darkness and cruelty await those who don't.</p>

      <p>Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit.  </p>
